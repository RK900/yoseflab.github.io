The broad goals of the research in the lab are to understand:

- How transcription is regulated in immune cells.
- How changes in transcription affect cell- and tissue-level phenotypes.

Beyond a basic scientific drive to study these fundamental questions, we are motivated by the translational potential of identifying and modulating the causes of transcriptional shifts. Our contribution to this wide area of research is in developing and applying computational tools (algorithms, software) to design, integrate and interpret large molecular data sets that can teach us about the regulation and the downstream effects of the transcriptional process.


The lab currently focuses on two related areas of research:

- [Modeling](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0229-2) and [interpreting](https://nature-research-under-consideration.nature.com/users/37265-nature-communications/posts/48921-integrated-single-cell-analysis-of-blood-and-cerebrospinal-fluid-leukocytes-in-multiple-sclerosis) the effects of heterogeneity between immune cells based on [single-cell genomics](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3711), with a focus on mRNA profiling.
- Exploring regulatory factors that govern cell state transitions based on [large-scale chromatin profiling assays](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27789799) and [massively parallel reporter assays](https://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/pdfExtended/S1934-5909(19)30421-7).

We pursue these areas primarily in the context of immune cells, covering various aspects of their biology, such as their [differentiation](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v496/n7446/full/nature11981.html), [stability](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature11984.html)/ plasticity, and response to acute [stimulation](http://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/retrieve/pii/S1097276512006570).
